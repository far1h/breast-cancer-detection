## Types of Breast Cancer:
1. Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS)
    a. Non-invasive
    b. Confined to milk ducts
    c. Early stage
2. Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC)
    a. Most common type
    b. Invades surrounding breast tissue
    c. Can spread to other parts of the body
3. Invasive Lobular Carcinoma (ILC)
    a. Originates in milk-producing lobules
    b. Invades surrounding breast tissue
    c. Can spread to other parts of the body
4. Triple-Negative Breast Cancer
    a. Lacks estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors
    b. More aggressive
    c. Limited treatment options
5. HER2-Positive Breast Cancer
    a. Overexpresses HER2 protein
    b. More aggressive
    c. Targeted therapies available
6. Inflammatory Breast Cancer
    a. Rare and aggressive
    b. Causes redness and swelling
    c. Often diagnosed at a later stage

## Symptoms of Breast Cancer:
1. Lump in the breast or underarm
2. Change in breast size or shape
3. Dimpling or puckering of the skin
4. Nipple discharge or inversion
5. Redness or scaling of the breast skin
6. Swelling of all or part of the breast
7. Pain in the breast or nipple

## Risk Factors for Breast Cancer:
1. Age (risk increases with age)
2. Family history of breast cancer
3. Genetic mutations (e.g., BRCA1, BRCA2)
4. Hormone replacement therapy
5. Alcohol consumption
6. Obesity
7. Lack of physical activity
8. Early menstruation or late menopause
9. Having children later in life or not at all
10. Radiation exposure

## Diagnosis of Breast Cancer:
1. Mammography
2. Ultrasound
3. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
4. Biopsy (fine needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, surgical biopsy)
5. Hormone receptor testing
6. HER2 testing
7. Genetic testing

## Treatment Options for Breast Cancer:
1. Surgery
    a. Lumpectomy
    b. Mastectomy
2. Radiation therapy
3. Chemotherapy
4. Hormone therapy
5. Targeted therapy
6. Immunotherapy
7. Clinical trials

## Prevention of Breast Cancer:
1. Regular screening and self-exams
2. Maintaining a healthy weight
3. Limiting alcohol consumption
4. Staying physically active
5. Eating a balanced diet
6. Avoiding hormone replacement therapy when possible
7. Discussing genetic testing with a healthcare provider if at high risk
